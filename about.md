Hello!  I'm a DevOps generalist currently working as a Principal Support Engineer at [EnterpriseDB](http://www.enterprisedb.com).  In addition to my background in a handful of technologies, I'm currently dabbling in containers and cloud computing to keep abreast of the rapidly-changing IT Operations landscape.  More information about my professional history can be found on [my linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richyen/).
