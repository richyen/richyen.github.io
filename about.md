Hello! I'm a longtime engineer who works at the intersection of databases, infrastructure, and systems that have to behave under real-world pressure. I’ve spent much of my career deep in the PostgreSQL ecosystem, helping teams design, scale, and troubleshoot production environments, often in the places where things get messy. I enjoy digging into performance problems, operational edge cases, and the kinds of issues that only show up once software meets reality. This site is where I write about PostgreSQL, reliability, infrastructure tooling, and practical lessons learned from years of hands-on experience. I care a lot about clear explanations and helping engineers build intuition about how systems actually work.  More information about my professional history can be found on [my linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richyen/).
